      <dt><h4>Overview</h4></dt> 
      <dd>SimulationCraft is a tool to explore combat mechanics in the popular MMO RPG World of Warcraft. 
      It is a multi-player event-driven simulator written in C++ that models raid damage. Increasing class 
      synergy and the prevalence of proc-based combat modifiers have eroded the accuracy of traditional 
      calculators that rely upon closed-form approximations to model very complex mechanics. The goal of 
      this simulator is to close the accuracy gap while maintaining a performance level high enough to 
      calculate relative stat weights to aid gear selection.</dd>
      <dt><h4>How This Interface Works</h4></dt>
      <dd>At its core, SimulationCraft is a parameter-driven batch simulation tool.  This interface is a 
      very light-weight wrapper that simply helps you build configuration scripts, pass them to the 
      simulator, and then evaluate the results.  It relies upon existing character profile management 
      sites to provide interactive manipulation of character talents, glyphs, gear, enchants, etc. 
      The three key steps are:
        <ol>
	<li> Generate your profile. 
	<li> Simlate your profile. 
	<li> Evaluate your results. 
        </ol>
      </dd>
      <dt><h4>Navigation</h4></dt>
      <dd>In general the flow is from left to right across the main tabs at the top of the window.  
      At <i>Globals</i> you set common high-level directives.  At <i>Import</i> you load your character 
      profile from a variety of sources.  At <i>Simulate</i> you make character-specific tweaks. 
      At <i>Overrides</i> a super-user can specify custom parameters that will persist from run to run. 
      At <i>Examples</i> you can see examples of all supported parameters including common usage. 
      At <i>Log</i> you will find simple text reporting as well as any errors encountered. 
      At <i>Results</i> you will find HTML output generated by the simulator. <b>Please note that the 
      behavior of the command line and the buttons to either side are context-sensitive. Their function 
      and labels may change as you navigate the main tabs.</b></dd>
